	I am new to git and programming in any kind of structured way.
 Admittedly, I am still very much at a loss as to how to use versioning software
 in general. Still learning.

Permutor v0.1

A small application to generate permutations of a given string. "Reduc" feature
 allow the number of characters to be reduced while still permuting all 
character from original string. Export to CSV allows saving values in a 
spreadsheet friendly format.

 * TODO:
 * - pretty up the aboutDialog, looks terrible
 * - Change window icon, use cool anime avatar
 * - "Bail out" button for (too) long strings
 * - Implement some kind of timer system?
 * 
 * DEBUG:
 * - get mainText to auto select on open (Driving me nuts!)
 * - fix 'this' leaks in constructor (not smart enough)
